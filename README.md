- View all the containers running in any stacks, with their info
- Pause/Unpause stacks and all related containers, or pause/unpause a single container
- Delete stacks and all related containers, or delete a single container

Through LokoAI you can also open _**Docker Utils Dashboard**_, where you have a GUI that you can navigate to manually monitoring all the containers, show their logs, and much more..
